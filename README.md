# In-The-Groove2-SM5
A Semi-Conversion/Recreation of In The Groove 2 to StepMania 5.

This is an attempt of recreating In The Groove 2's overall theme into the StepMania 5 engine.
I a aware that someone already did a port of this, but it was incredibly weird and flat.

This attempts to make (at most if possible) a 1:1 recreation of the original theme.

A Semi-Conversion/Recreation of In The Groove 2 to StepMania 5.

This is an attempt of recreating In The Groove 2's overall theme into the StepMania 5 engine, to make (at most if possible) a 1:1 recreation of the original theme.

## Features

### ITG 1 and 2 schemes
The theme features the visual interfaces of both games, including full translations for Spanish, Italian, German, and French from the PC edition of In The Groove.

such as the Menu timer toggle, and Long/Marathon song display.

### In The Groove PC option layouts
To ease movement and provide a better home play experience, the options menu utilizes the layout from the PC version of the game.
